## 💡 Description

Firezone is a self-hosted VPN server and Linux firewall:

- Manage remote access through an intuitive web interface and CLI utility.
- [Deploy on your own infrastructure](https://docs.firezone.dev/deploy?utm_source=readme)
  to keep control of your network traffic.

  and lightweight.

> [!TIP]
> Firezone `legacy` branch (v0.7) hit EoL on January 31st 2024.

## 💎 Features

  [3-4 times](https://wireguard.com/performance/) faster than OpenVPN.
- **SSO Integration:** Authenticate using any identity provider with an OpenID
  Connect (OIDC) connector.
- **Containerized:** All dependencies are bundled via Docker.
- **Simple:** Takes minutes to set up. Manage via a simple CLI.
- **Secure:** Runs unprivileged. HTTPS enforced. Encrypted cookies.
- **Firewall included:** Uses Linux [nftables](https://netfilter.org) to block
  unwanted egress traffic.

### 🚫 Anti-features

Firezone is **not:**

- An inbound firewall
- A tool for creating mesh networks
- A full-featured router
- An IPSec or OpenVPN server

## 🐋 Installation

Firezone can be installed via Docker and Docker Compose.

A public Docker image is provided on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/l4rm4nd/firezone).

````bash
# download compose file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l4rm4nd/firezone/legacy/docker-compose.yml

# generate an .env file
docker run --rm ghcr.io/l4rm4nd/firezone:latest bin/gen-env > .env

# adjust .env file to your needs
# define EXTERNAL_URL + DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL + DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD

# disable telemetry via .env
echo -e "\nTELEMETRY_ENABLED=false" >> .env

# enable local auth
echo -e "\nLOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true" >> .env

# migrate database and create admin user
docker compose run --rm firezone bin/migrate
docker compose run --rm firezone bin/create-or-reset-admin

# spawn the container stack
docker compose up -d
````

Afterwards, the admin mgmt UI is accessible on http://127.0.0.1:13000.

It is recommended to combine Firezone with a TLS reverse proxy such as Traefik as well as with an Identity Provider (IdP) such as Keycloak or Authentik for Single-Sign-On (SSO). Once SSO is enabled, you should disable the possibility for local authentication via the `.env` file.
